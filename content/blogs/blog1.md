"In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love.

In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile.

In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.

I realized through it all, that.....

In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there's something stronger - something better, pushing right back."

- Albert Camus

My favorite quote of all time and something I always keep in my back pocket. This doesn't have much to do with investing by I thought it was worth sharing.

“Look for people who have lots of great questions. Smart people are the ones who ask the most thoughtful questions, as opposed to thinking they have all the answers. Great questions are a much better indicator of future success than great answers.”

― Ray Dalio, Principles: Life and Work

This is one of my favorite quotes. If you know me, you know that I am well aware of my shortcomings and although I have been interested in global markets for almost my entire life - I understand that I will never have the answer to everything.

Ray Dalio is one person who continues to inspire my approach to understanding the global macroeconomic ecosystem as well as understanding my own thoughts and feelings. His work on the importance of debt cycles throughout economic history and the role they play in asset bubbles has been a constant reference point throughout my investing career.

“The fact that a thesis is flawed does not mean that we should not invest in it as long as other people believe in it and there is a large group of people left to be convinced. The point was made by John Maynard Keynes when he compared the stock market to a beauty contest where the winner is not the most beautiful contestant but the one whom the greatest number of people consider beautiful. Where I have something significant to add is in pointing out that it pays to look for the flaws; if we find them, we are ahead of the game because we can limit our losses when the market also discovers what we already know. It is when we are unaware of what could go wrong that we have to worry.”

― George Soros

This quote comes from "The Alchemy of Finance". If you haven't read it, I'd highly recommend. I credit this book with sparking my interest in global macro. Soros is known as one of the best investors of all time but he is much more than that. Of course - he's a bit of a controversial figure - but his work on reflexivity was truly fascinating. 

Reflexivity generally refers to the examination of one's own beliefs, judgments and practices during the research process and how these may have influenced the research. If positionality refers to what we know and believe then reflexivity is about what we do with this knowledge.

The quote above illustrates this concept of reflexivity quite well. George Soros has taken the stance that the perception of reality is even more real than reality itself - especially in markets. I could type away about the importance of this concept from an epistemological perspective in theory as well as in practice but most of you just want to see where my money is invested - so I'll just leave you with this link:

My Investments

Currently (10/21/2020) I'm a huge fan of Copper. It's a basic supply/demand relationship conviction. 

1. China consumes 50% of the world's copper.
  - Manufacturing/construction sectors are posting a strong recovery
  - 50% m/m increase in copper imports
  - 30% y/y increase
  - Chinese gov't support in the form of tax exemptions + lower borrowing rates for the       manufacturing sector
  - 3.75T RMN to be issued to finance new infastruction program
  
2. Top 2 copper producers (Chile & Peru) are very disrupted by COVID
  - In Peru, copper output fell 42% in May
  - Chile's state-run miner (Codelco) remains temporarily closed
  
3. Rise of Renewable Energy
  - Copper is best non-precious metal conductor of electricity due to lack of resistance
  - Global copper demand for solar & wind energy systems is expected to rise by 56% by        2027
  
4. Electric Vehicles
  - Copper is used in batteries, motors, + wiring
  - Average of 83kg for EV's vs. 20kg for a normal car
